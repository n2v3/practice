Heading

The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

Note: Only use one <h1> per page - this should represent the main heading/subject for the whole page.
Also, do not skip heading levels - start with <h1>, then use <h2>, and so on.
-->
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

<!--
Paragraph

The <p> tag defines a paragraph.

Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each <p> element.

-->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!--

Void elements are self-closing and do not require a separate closing tag.
They are used to insert elements into the HTML document without any content.

Here are some common void elements in HTML:

<br>: Represents a line break within a text block.
<img>: Represents an image.
<input>: Represents an input control.
<meta>: Provides metadata about the HTML document.
<link>: Defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
<hr> is an HTML element used to represent a thematic break or horizontal rule in a document.
